# HomeOffice Button - Report Generator
This report generator will fetch time tracking events for previous month, calculates and formats a time tracking report and publish it to a defined target, e.g. to AWS S3.
To automate report generation you can schedule it via CloudWatch events, e.g. each 3rd workday of a month, as a Lambda function.
This report generator belongs to the [HomeOffice Button - Time Tracking](https://github.com/tommzn/hob-timetracker) Project.
